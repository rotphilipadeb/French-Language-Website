                    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction to French Culture</h2>
                    <p>The French culture is a rich tapestry woven from a historical legacy, 
                        artistic brilliance, and a deep appreciation for the finer things in life. 
                        France, often hailed as the epitome of sophistication and romance, has a 
                        cultural identity that has significantly influenced the global landscape. 
                        At the heart of French culture lies a passion for the arts, with iconic contributions 
                        to literature, cinema, and the visual arts. From the profound works of existentialist 
                        philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre to the cinematic masterpieces of directors such as François 
                        Truffaut, French intellectual and artistic pursuits have left an indelible mark on the world.</p>

                        <p><h3>French Cuisine</h3>
                            <img src="cuisine.jpg" alt="French Cuisine">
                            Cuisine is another cornerstone of French culture, where meals are not 
                            just a means of sustenance but a celebration of gastronomy. The French
                             take pride in their culinary expertise, and each region boasts its own
                              specialties, reflecting a diverse range of flavors and techniques. 
                              Additionally, the French are known for their appreciation of fashion, 
                              with Paris standing as a global fashion capital.</p>
                        
                        <p><h3>French National Pride</h3>
                            <img src="flag.jpg" alt="French Flag">
                            Social rituals and etiquette are deeply ingrained in French society, 
                            emphasizing politeness and respect. The French also hold a strong sense 
                            of national pride, evident in their commitment to preserving their 
                            language, history, and traditions. Overall, the French culture is a 
                            harmonious blend of elegance, intellectualism, and a profound appreciation 
                            for the art of living.</p>
                        <p><h3>Language</h3>
                            As the official language of France, French is the first language of 88% of the population. 
                            Even then, most others speak French as a second language.</p>
                            
                            <p>However, minority languages flourish in specific regions. For example, eastern 
                                provinces speak German while Flemish is spoken in the northeast and Italian is
                                 spoken in the southeast. Other communities within France speak several other 
                                 languages.</p>
                            
                            <p><h3>Family</h3>
                            The family has served as the founding unit of French society for generations. 
                            Traditionally, the family structure could include either extended families or 
                            nuclear families. In recent years, that structure has shifted to primarily reflect
                             nuclear families as well as variations such as single-parent households or civil unions 
                             known as PACS.</p>
